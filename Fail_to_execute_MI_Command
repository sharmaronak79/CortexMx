STLINKUTILITY
I had the same problem with the Discovery board

> check cable and try changing the port if it still exists then do the following steps, I solved by this way.



Download this ST-Link Utility from ST website as shown in figure

Connect your device like discovery board to PC

click on connect to the target, if it shows an error then click on a firmware update.

again click on connect device, it will show the latest version or an older one, once click on update firmware.

after updating once again click on connect the target it will connected and then try to debug from IDE
