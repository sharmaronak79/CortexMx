The ARM Cortex-M is a group of 32-bit RISC ARM processor cores licensed by Arm Holdings. 
These cores are optimized for low-cost and energy-efficient integrated circuits, which have been embedded in tens of billions of consumer devices.
[1] Though they are most often the main component of microcontroller chips, sometimes they are embedded inside other types of chips too.
The Cortex-M family consists of Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M33, Cortex-M35P, Cortex-M55.
[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] The Cortex-M4 / M7 / M33 / M35P / M55 cores have an FPU silicon option, 
and when included in the silicon these cores are sometimes known as "Cortex-Mx with FPU" or "Cortex-MxF", where 'x' is the core number.
