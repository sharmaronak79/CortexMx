Processor works o 2 modes:

1. Thread mode
2. Handler mode

Processor always starts on thread mode
And in thread mode it is in PAL privileged access level
When it goes to NPAL non privileged access level ,
It is nit possible to be back in PAL.

When a function calls to anither function then it goes in 
Handler mode and in handler mode processor always in PAL
