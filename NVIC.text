In a microcontroller, such as those at the heart of industrial motion controllers,
interrupts serve as a way to immediately divert the central processing unit from its current task to another, more important task.

An interrupt can be triggered internally from the microcontroller (MCU) or externally, by a peripheral.
The interrupt alerts the central processing unit (CPU) to an occurrence such as a time-based event
(a specified amount of time has elapsed or a specific time is reached, for example), 
a change of state, or the start or end of a process.

Nested vector interrupt control (NVIC) is a method of prioritizing interrupts,
improving the MCUâ€™s performance and reducing interrupt latency. NVIC also provides implementation schemes 
for handling interrupts that occur when other interrupts are being executed or
when the CPU is in the process of restoring its previous state and resuming its suspended process.
