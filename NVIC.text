In a microcontroller, such as those at the heart of industrial motion controllers,
interrupts serve as a way to immediately divert the central processing unit from its current task to another, more important task.

An interrupt can be triggered internally from the microcontroller (MCU) or externally, by a peripheral.
The interrupt alerts the central processing unit (CPU) to an occurrence such as a time-based event
(a specified amount of time has elapsed or a specific time is reached, for example), 
a change of state, or the start or end of a process.
